Some good sources for these data are a nonprofit's Customer Relationship Management (CRM) database, donation receipts, and records of appeals sent and responded to. In addition, nonprofits may turn to peoplesearch sites or census census data for additional demographics information. As much as possible, nonprofits should try to get information about individual donors. This will allow the results to be applicable to individuals. \n",
